1. You have to install python on your OS.
2. Then Run, "meals.py" on your terminal or command prompt using this command, "python3 meals.py"
3. Enter your meal list one by one.(Breakfast: Bread, Milk, Banana...)
4. That's it! To see this, you can open "meal-list.html" file or run "server.py" using this command, "python3 server.py" on terminal/cmd
(NOTE: Meal list updated automatically for same day. Otherwise, it shows one after another respectively.)
Enjoy!
